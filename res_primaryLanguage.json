When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my hobbies - playing video games, building Lego sets and Gundam models, and keeping fit through regular workouts. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest tech stacks. Above all, I pride myself on being a kind and fun-loving person, always ready to connect and learn from others. Let's chat and see what we can create together!",
